XAMPP is a popular open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages. Here are step-by-step instructions on how to run a project using XAMPP:

* Download and Install XAMPP:
* After Installing Start Apache and MySQL server
* Open your web browser and enter http://localhost in the address bar. If XAMPP is running correctly, you should see the XAMPP dashboard.
* Create a Project Folder:
  Create a folder in the htdocs directory inside your XAMPP installation directory. This will be the root folder for your project.
* Place all the files inside the project folder you created in the htdocs directory.
* Database Setup (Optional):
  If your project involves a database, you can use the phpMyAdmin tool bundled with XAMPP to create databases and tables.
  Open your web browser and enter http://localhost/phpmyadmin.
  Use the interface to create your database and tables.
* Access Your Project:
  Open your web browser and enter http://localhost/your_project_folder (ex: feed_back_form ) in the address bar, replacing your_project_folder 
  with the name of the folder you created. You should now see your project.
 
That's it! You've successfully set up and run a project using XAMPP. Remember to start Apache and MySQL each time you want to work on your project, 
and stop them when you're done.


I use mysql database and the database name is survey_db.
The database table structure you provided is for a table named feedback within a database named survey_db.
